# Capstone-Paper
MPH - Infectious Disease and Vaccinology paper - "Modeling of Antibiotic Resistant Gonorrhea to Determine Economic Value of Interventions"

This is a condensed version of the capstone paper (aka mini thesis) which I wrote for my degree. 

Due to time crunch, the programing for this paper was done using Berkeley Madonna, a differential equation solver. I will be updating it to work in R. The paper has very many caveats, and the model has not been fitted due to lack of useful data.
