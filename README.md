# MPH - Infectious Disease and Vaccinology paper:
Modeling of Antibiotic Resistant Gonorrhea to Determine Economic Value of Interventions
------

This is a condensed version of the capstone paper (aka mini thesis) which I wrote for my Masters' degree.

Due to time crunch, the programing for this paper was done using Berkeley Madonna, a differential equation solver. I will be updating it to work in R. This will be an ongoing project that is relatively low priority for me.  

You can read the entire paper I turned in here, but there are a huge number of caveats, and the model has not been fitted due to lack of useful data. I am making this available mostly as a historical document.
